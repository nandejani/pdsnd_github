Python Script to Explore US Bikeshare Data
This is project 2 for Udacity’s Programming for Data Science course. This code explores the bikeshare data of Chicago, Washington, and New York City. It is meant to calculate statistics about the 3 bikeshare systems and presents this information in an interactive user-friendly way.
How to Access The Files
You need python installed, an interpreter like atom, and your terminal. Categorize all the
CSV files and the bikeshare.py file together and run them on your terminal/using an
interpreter.
Computed Statistics
● What is the most popular month in the start time?
● What day of the week (Monday, Tuesday, etc.) is the most popular in the start
time?
● What hour of the day is the most popular in the start time?
● What are the total trip duration and average trip duration?
● What is the most often used start station?
● What is the most often used end station?
● What is the most popular trip (i.e., the combination of start station and end station
that occurs the most often)?
● What are the user type counts?
● What are the gender counts?
● What is the earliest birth year, most recent birth year, and most common birth
year?
Data Extracted
● Start Time
● End Time
● Trip Duration (in seconds)
● Start Station
● End Station
● User Type (Subscriber or Customer)
Only in Chicago and New York City files:
● Gender
● Birth Year
